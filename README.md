#Synopsis
As many educational institutions, the institution I work for has also shifted to online classes, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

A new need arose as the recorded lectures had to be branded and prepended with a disclaimer.

The supposed process was that for every recorded lecture, a request was created and small group of two - capable of video editing - would master approximately 14 lectures each for a total of nearly 700 courses.

As most of the videos consist only of trimming the start and end of recorded video lectures, this workload could be offloaded to faculty members or their assistants. Leaving us more time to deal with more complicated videos.

The app is simple. Load the video. Type in when your video starts and when it ends. Press "Render".

In order to change the disclaimer and logo, change the png files.
